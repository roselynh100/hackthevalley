      "info": "Contrary to popular belief, salmon sushi does not originate from Japan. Prior to the 1990s, salmon was a fish only used in cheap Japanese meals, and was never eaten raw due to fear of infections from parasites. Only after a project by the Norwegians – who were commercial salmon farming and needed customers – did raw salmon start to catch on in Japan."

In attendance of the banquet were many in power, however there were few ingredients available – mosty army rations, barely any fresh produce, and just a bit of meat. Wanting to fuse Italian and Anglo-Saxon cuisine, carbonara alla spaghetti was created."
